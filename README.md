## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com) - For date manipulation
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - For styles

### What I learned

- Efficient usage of useStates
- Proper error handling
- Customizing the use of Tailwind CSS

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This helped me to familiarize more on the syntax used on tailwind. Definitely will use it more later on.
- [Moment.js Documentatio](https://momentjs.com/docs/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
